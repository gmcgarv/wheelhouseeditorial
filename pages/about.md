<h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm Gillian McGarvey, an editor and content leader. I partner with authors, publishers, and product teams to ship
clear, credible writing—on deadline. I’m especially experienced in technical domains like security, observability,
and AI.</p>

<p>Before freelancing, I led editorial teams and built processes that help writers do their best work. Today I bring
that same systems mindset to every engagement.</p>
