  <h1>Testimonials</h1>

  <blockquote>
    “Gillian’s edits were incisive and kind. She found the true story and helped us tell it. She really makes authors look better than they are. I highly recommend her for her competence and expertise as a technical editor.”
    <cite>— Casimir Saternos, Author & Engineer</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    “We’ve found Wheelhouse Editorial to be the perfect fit for our current project, The Wit and Wisdom of Bina48, a collection of conversations with an A.I. (artificial intelligence) humanoid. Gillian really helped to improve the project not only with her meticulous attention to detailed copyediting of the manuscript but also with the substantive ‘big picture’ developmental edit suggestions for the project as a whole. As a first-time author, I appreciated Gillian’s mix of professionalism, warmth and sense of humor that she brought to our collaboration.”
    <cite>— Bruce Duncan, Author & Managing Director, Terasem Movement Foundation</cite>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    “Gillian is organized, thorough, and responds promptly. She is always on her deadlines. To add to that, she is a gem of a person as well. She cares and she’s funny.”
    <cite>— Jennifer Gress, Author & Engineer</cite>
  </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
    “Gillian McGarvey did a Herculean job of finding sources for and doing complete fact checks on a complex book on economics, written over several years. Several people attempted to find the sources previously and gave up. But Gillian did the impossible. She did it in an elegant and easy-to-follow format. I can’t imagine a more professional and thorough job of editing a manuscript. I’m in awe of her work and work ethic. Her contribution to the work is inestimable.”
    <cite>— Lisa Stark, Author & Economist</cite>
  </blockquote>
  
   <blockquote>
    “Throughout the process, she did a great job with communication and provided lots of useful feedback. I’d love to work with her again.”
    <cite>— Yevgeniy Brikman, Author & Engineer</cite>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    “I’m usually pretty prickly about my work being edited, but my pricklyometer hardly moved off zero this time.”
    <cite>— Alan Cohen, Product Leader & Engineer</cite>
